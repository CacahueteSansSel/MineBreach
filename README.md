# MineBreach
A server-side minigame based on the Garry's Mod gamemode **Breach (SCP)** and the game **SCP: Secret Laboratory**, but adapted for the Minecraft universe.
This gamemode does **not** include any **SCP** content, as it replaces it with **Minecraft look-alikes**.

# Structure
The project is structured into several parts:
- **src**: The Fabric server-side source code & included resources.
- **layouts** : The different generation layouts for each floor in the map
- **resourcepack** : The required resource pack (if you need to setup a server, you will need it)
- **tools** : The tools used at build time (e.g. the map layout builder)

# Special Thanks
- **Garry's Mod** (for the Breach gamemode)
- **SCP: Secret Laboratory** (the big inspiration for basically everything)
